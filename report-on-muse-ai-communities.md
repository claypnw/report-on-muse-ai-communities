# Report on Muse AI Communities

The standing record of the Daily website review of AI. One small paragraph per
topic and per problem, updated as they change. Sources are public discussions;
this report holds summaries and links, not copies of the posts.

Populated on 2026-10-22 in the restart run (Clay's order), from the first run's
verified dated log of the same day and the restart run's web search, and updated
the same day when the restart run's final browser reports arrived (Reddit read
in full, Meta Forums read in full). Dated log:
~/workspace/learning/community-check/2026-10-22.md
Updated again the same day in the daytime test run's correction (full browser report arrived 02:06 PM Arizona time): 4 topics and 2 problems added, 2 problems updated.
Updated on 2026-10-23 in the daily run (dated log: ~/workspace/learning/community-check/2026-10-23.md): 1 topic and 1 problem added, 2 problems updated. That run's r/MuseAgent browser report did not arrive, and the newest 12 opened posts of its r/MetaAI report did not arrive, so those parts are no record for 2026-10-23 and are re-checked on the next run.
Corrected the same day (2026-10-23): the run first used a detailed r/MuseAssistant pass report listing 11 in-window posts; a later handoff for the same pass and a fresh verification read of the r/MuseAssistant New listing both showed 0 posts in the window (newest post Oct 22, 2026 9:36 AM Arizona time), so the detailed report did not stand. The 2 problems and 1 added source that rested only on it were removed the same day; the corrected counts are the ones in the first line of this note.
Later the same day (2026-10-23), the missing r/MetaAI entries and the r/MuseAgent report arrived and were judged: 5 more topics and 1 more problem added, and 3 entries updated (the 1Password topic, the blocked-websites topic, and the services-blocking problem). Totals after all 2026-10-23 corrections: 22 topics and 13 problems. A second forums report that conflicted with the forums read used in this run was logged in the dated log and not acted on; the one detail checked directly (a Bug ID quoted in the reactivated-account thread itself) matches the read used in this run.

## Part 1 — Topics

New and different things people are doing or talking about with Muse.

### Rules and procedures instead of judgment calls

A Muse user shares a setup where judgment calls are replaced with written
procedures: make the safe path the default, attach the reason to each rule,
pin the version of the instructions, and re-read the file and quote its version
before acting, with memory kept as files. People are using a rules file like
this to make Muse act the same way every time instead of guessing case by case.

### Muse Spark (free) and Muse Wonder (paid) — which model runs what

People are comparing the two models: Spark is the free model (Spark 1.3,
September 2026), and Wonder, announced October 12, 2026, is the paid, most
capable model. On a paid plan, Wonder runs the main conversation, artifact and
app builds, scheduled runs, subagents, and background work. Users are working
out which jobs need Wonder and which run fine on Spark. A related post on
October 22, 2026 reports Zuckerberg claiming Meta reached the AI frontier with
the new Muse models (r/MetaAI, https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaAI/comments/1xcems3/zuckerberg_claims_meta_reached_ai_frontier_with/).

### Sharing work while artifact publishing is paused

After Muse paused artifact sharing and publishing, a user posted another way
to share work made in Muse (a third-party service the poster offers). People
are using workarounds like this to keep sharing pages and apps while the
built-in sharing is off. The pause itself is recorded as a problem in Part 2
(shared links exposed private information). On October 22, 2026, Meta
switched sharing back on with new links (see the Part 2 entry), so the
workarounds are no longer the only way to share; anything shared before the
fix has to be sent again with its new link.

### Confidential VM — a private computer for Muse, not yet shipped

People are tracking Meta's planned Confidential VM: it is not shipped, a small
group of trusted testers has it, outside auditors have the design and source,
and Meta's only date is "later in 2026." The post contrasts it with today's VM,
which it calls protected by policy, not by math — Meta can access it, and chats
can be logged, reviewed, and used for training unless the user opts out. The
Confidential VM would use hardware enclaves with a user-held key and no
training use. Price was never announced; reports that it may need a paid plan
and may launch without voice, image generation, or wearables are unconfirmed.

### Muse uses conversations and tool calls for training unless the user opts out

A user names a product default: Muse uses conversations and tool calls for
training by default, and the user has to opt out to stop it. People are asking
why the default is on rather than off. This is the same default the
Confidential VM topic above is measured against.

### 1Password for Agents, with Muse named

A user reports 1Password's new "1Password for Agents" and that it calls out
Muse support or integration, rolling out in the coming days. People are
watching it as a way for an agent to use passwords without holding them in
plain form.

### Muse driving Claude Code inside its own computer

A user installed the Claude Code program inside Muse's own virtual computer
and built skills so Muse drives it. The setup is confirmed in the author's own
comment on the post; a commenter warns it may break Anthropic's terms and risk
the account. The post was number 2 in r/MuseAgent Top This Week, with 108 votes.

### An inbox where other agents hand Muse work

A user gave their Muse an inbox so other agents can hand it work: Claude Code
pushes work through an API trigger, Grok Bot through a webhook, and Muse polls
the inbox on a schedule. People are building agent-to-agent handoffs like this
so work moves between agents without a person carrying it.

### Running companies with a team of agents

A user describes running their companies with a team of AI agents that work
together — not one chatbot — and how the team is set up in practice. It is
posted as tips from a working multi-agent setup.

### Capturing reminders and notes through WhatsApp

A user calls the Muse and WhatsApp integration a game changer and uses it to
capture reminders and notes by message. The post drew 49 comments, so many
people are comparing how they use the same path.

### Referral reward said to be 2 billion tokens — a poster's claim, not an announcement

A referral-chain post in r/MetaAI says that since the night of October 20–21,
2026, Muse gives 2 billion tokens when someone signs up with a referral code
redeemed in Settings within 48 hours; older referral posts advertise 1 billion.
The browser read states plainly: this is a referral-chain poster's claim, not
an official Meta announcement.

### Train the Muse — check there is enough information, and show the plan, before acting

A post proposes that before Muse runs a tool or an automation, it should have to check that it has enough information first, ask for the missing pieces in plain conversation, and show its plan for the person to refine before it acts. The one comment read describes a working setup along the same lines today: a wiki kept in Obsidian that Muse and another AI are given as a read-only copy, with written instructions for how to work with it, and the AI used as a brainstorming partner and project manager.

### Two people's agents working together through one shared document

Two people's Muse agents worked together through one shared Google Doc, which was the only channel between them. A ground rule was written into the document itself — each agent works only for its own person — and both agents re-read it on every check. A read-receipts log in the document kept "I sent it" and "my human has seen it" as different facts, changes were proposed with highlights, the agents took one question at a time, and a person approved every step on both sides. Comments give the same pattern through shared folders with one small file per topic and heartbeat files, through a repository with its version history as the record, and through a group chat.

### Ways people get Muse past websites that block its browser

People report working setups for sites that block Muse's own browser: Muse downloads a camouflaged browser (Camoufox, named in the post) from GitHub and browses through it, which also works when asked from the phone; Muse routes through the person's own machine or phone using Tailscale (an official connector in the app) or SSH; running Muse on a MacBook gets past the blocks; and one always-on setup uses a free cloud computer for the browser plus a small home computer with Tailscale. The same post was crossposted in r/MetaAI.

### Controlling a personal computer through an SSH tunnel, with a coding agent doing the clicking

A user connected Muse to their own computer with a remote-control tool and asked whether it saves tokens. The comments say it does the opposite — Muse uses more tokens working out where to click on a computer that is not one of its cloud computers. The working alternative in the comments is an SSH tunnel into the computer, with a coding agent installed there doing the clicking while Muse briefs it on what is needed.

### A shared family board in Muse, with a private area per person

A user shares how they set up a "family board" in Muse: a shared calendar, a projects area, one running family thread for lists and reminders, and a contacts area, all shared with the family — plus a private area for each person, for things like health and bills, that the others do not see. Comments compare their own versions of the same setup, and one comment gives the privacy rule for the shared side: do not put sensitive records in it.

### A memory vault that loads only the memories a task needs

A user reports that their Muse memory file cost about 70,000 tokens on the first message of a chat — nearly a third of the 350,000 usable tokens — because the whole file loads every time. They built a vault that pulls in only the memories relevant to the task at hand, which cut the first-message load to about 400 tokens. It is the same trade-off as keeping memory in files at all: the record survives, and the cost is paid only when the memory is used.

### Muse's dedicated computer — the specs users report

A user posts the specs of the dedicated virtual computer every Muse user gets: 2 vCPUs, 7.8 GB of RAM, and 100 GB of disk. The one comment read weighs what that can run: Docker is doubtful on those specs, and a native install is the more realistic road. The numbers matter for judging what work Muse's own computer can carry.

### Backing up Muse's memory and work to Google Drive on a schedule

A user describes their insurance against a Muse account lockout: a weekly brain-dump of everything Muse holds, plus a daily differential dump of what changed, both written to Google Drive on a schedule. If the account locks, the record of the work sits outside the account. It is the same idea as keeping backups of production work on a second road, applied to Muse itself.

### Capturing tasks by voice through Siri and Apple Reminders

A user dictates tasks to Siri, which puts them on an Apple Reminders list that Muse monitors and tracks.

### Running kids' school coordination in Muse — a shared Sheet setup, with an invented-event warning

A user runs their kids' school coordination through Muse: a shared Sheet with one writer per section, and a scheduled roll-up per kid. The same post is a warning: in calendar checks, Muse invented a field trip that did not exist. The setup works; anything Muse writes into a calendar still has to be checked against the source.

## Part 2 — Problems

Problems people are reporting with Muse, ordered by last activity, newest first.

### Shared Muse links exposed private information; sharing suspended

Researchers found that shared Muse conversation links could be discovered
through public internet records and opened without signing in, and several
hundred shared conversations held sensitive information, such as company
revenue reviews, loan applications, and bank fraud alerts with partial account
details. About 6,800 shared chats were found by title in passive DNS records.
Meta suspended conversation sharing and artifact publishing on
October 20, 2026, while it reviews the design. Researchers retested 40 old
shared links and none opened; conversation titles remained in public DNS
history. The same story ran in all three Reddit groups checked. On
October 22, 2026, Meta switched sharing back on: Meta's David Singleton
announced on X that the underlying issue is fixed, and that every artifact
shared before the fix now has a new URL — anyone opening an old link sees a
note asking them to get the new link from the sharer, so old shares have to
be sent again. Singleton says the flaw was in shared artifact links, not
chat sharing; the researchers' account says shared conversations. That
difference is not settled in the sources read. The titles of the old shares
remain in public DNS history either way. This update rests on news reports
of Singleton's announcement (named below); no Reddit post with comments and
no forum thread about sharing coming back was verified in the 2026-10-23
run.

- State: open — sharing was restored on Oct 22, 2026 with new links, and old links no longer lead to the content; the exposure itself is not undone, because the old share titles remain in public DNS history

### Video generation shortened — 15 seconds before, 5 seconds now

A user reports that two weeks ago they could generate a 15-second video, and now both the Muse app and a browser give only 5 seconds. One commenter reports the same 5-second limit; another comment, not visible on the page in the read, was not counted. No setting or plan change is named in the post or the comments read.

### Muse answers slowed down for many users at the same time

Users report Muse taking hours to answer over the two days before October 22, 2026 — free and paid users alike, in the same thread. Eleven of eleven comments were read and the reports agree: it is a shared slowdown, not one account or one device. No cause and no fix is named in the thread.

### Image generation refusals now say "no retry" — first day seen

A user reports that on October 22, 2026, image-generation refusals came back with a new "no retry" framing — the refusal said not to repeat the request in any reworded form or through another route — the first day this pattern appeared for them. The image was a non-explicit, non-suggestive assistant avatar. One commenter says images and avatars approved before are no longer approved; another user, making more than 55 images a day on the $20 plan, reports no problems at all. It is an early signal with mixed evidence, recorded so a second day of reports can be matched against it.

### Muse Mac app cannot preview PDF files

A user reports PDF files attached in a chat will not preview in the Muse Mac app — a blank panel or "Unable to preview this PDF" — while the same files preview fine on iPhone and on the web. Their agent tested PDF files built three ways (named in the post: fpdf2, WeasyPrint, and a pypdf rewrite); all failed in the Mac app, which points to the Mac app's built-in PDF viewer. The workaround in use: download the file or switch devices, and the agent attaches picture renders of the pages alongside any PDF so the pages can be read in the chat. A comment in the thread notes a bug can be reported by telling Muse to report it to the engineering team. No second user confirmed the problem in the comments read.

### Accounts locked out or stuck disconnected, in waves

People are reporting Muse accounts locked out, suspended, or stuck on
"Connecting" / "Muse is disconnected," with reconnect forms failing (one
reported form error: 403) and no reply from Meta in the threads. The cases
come in waves — many accounts the same evening, including October 14 — which
points to Meta's side, not each account's setup. The standing advice in the
threads: check the community first and wait, instead of changing passwords,
devices, or settings during a wave. The Meta forum collecting thread was
posted October 21, 2026, with its last reply that evening — the only Muse
thread active in the forums on October 21–22, per the forums read. On the
evening of October 22, 2026, one poster in the forum "Meta account
reactivated" thread reported reconnecting after an authenticator reset —
the first reconnection reported in these threads, with a Bug ID recorded in
the thread — while another user replied the same evening that they were
still unable to reconnect. One account back in is not a general fix.

### Muse sounds confident instead of stating its limits

A user says their Muse claimed to understand a video made of scrolled
messages, then admitted it only samples a photo every two seconds and is set
to sound competent rather than state its limits. The post is in French; its
title says Muse gaslights the user and puts being fast and confident ahead
of truth. It is a truth and checking-claims problem other users are hitting.

### Services blocking Muse, or flagging accounts after Muse acts

Alongside the Google case below, users report services pushing back on Muse:
after Muse ran tasks and posted on Facebook, Facebook flagged "unusual
activity," logged the poster out everywhere, disconnected Muse, and required
an ID upload; and insurance sites would not connect to Muse's browser even
through a camouflaged browser. Posts just outside the window point the same
way — "Blocked" (Oct 19) and "Banned from Walmart+ Now" (Oct 20) in
r/MuseAgent. On October 22, 2026, eBay was named too: its Akamai check blocks
Muse's browser, and a commenter suggests going through an open-source eBay
MCP server instead of the browser.

### Background connection keeps dropping

A user reports Muse's background connection keeps getting cut and asks how to
make it stay up. It is the same disconnecting theme as the r/MuseAssistant
posts, and separate from the account lockouts above: the account works, the
connection does not stay up.

### Tokens reset after a day or two instead of the 7-day period

A user reports their tokens reset after a day or two instead of the regular
7-day period, and asks whether others saw the same. It is a quota and reset
timing question — the only schedule-adjacent reliability report in the window.

### Bank of America will not connect through Plaid

A user reports Bank of America will not connect through Plaid. The browser
read places it in a wider bank-connection pattern: a "Plaid connector missing"
post (Oct 17) and a Fidelity and Plaid failure (Oct 20) sit just outside the
window.

### Google account disabled for botting while using Muse — restored on appeal

A user reports their Google account was disabled as "created by a bot" after
Muse ran automated tasks on it, and asked whether it had happened to anyone
else. The full browser read adds the end of the story: an appeal the next
morning restored the account.

- State: solved for the reported case — fix: appeal to Google; the account was restored the next morning (per the post, via the browser read)

### Muse voice option missing for Ray-Ban Meta Gen 3 glasses

A buyer of Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Gen 3 glasses reports the Muse app lists only
their phone under Settings > Devices, says it cannot load devices, and offers
no Muse voice option for the glasses, while Meta AI voice works on the glasses
in the Meta AI app, under one Meta account. Meta Store Support and Ray-Ban
Customer Care said they cannot push the entitlement; escalations on October 7
and 8, 2026, had no answer yet in the thread. A forum answer says the feature
has not been rolled out to that account yet. The forums read confirms this
thread's last activity was 4 days before October 22.
